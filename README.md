<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Repositorify is a project influenced by *Shopify Developer Intern Challenge*, a challenge that allows an applicant to showcase their capabilities in building a whole application from scratch. The idea of such a challenge is great because applicants are not limited to using a stack, or being limited to specific challenges. This is an opportunity for applicants to showcase not only their software development skills, but also their critical thinking!

The first version of Repositorify took me less than 12 hours of development. The whole project is basically an image repository where users can upload and search for images.
